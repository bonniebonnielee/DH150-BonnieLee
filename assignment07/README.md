## Graphic Design
Below are three distinctive screen designs that represent the user-interface design of my application with standard graphical components.

### How were decisions made?
For the colour scheme, I wanted something bright and enticing so users would be drawn to the application. However, since users are expected to be on this application for an extended period of time, the colour must be soothing to the eyes and not too garish. Both applications I analyzed for the heuristic evaluation (HKTVMall and Instacart) used green as their primary colour -- in order to differentiate my application from theirs, I decided not to use green. Below are four versions I created with different colours:

After creating the four versions, I decided to seek an outside perspective:

It seemed that both individuals preferred the red scheme, with one also liking the blue one. In order to decide, I used an accessibility checker to ensure that my colour scheme would be appropriate and userfriendly for all. 

## Impression Test
A recording of my impression test can be found via [this link](https://ucla.zoom.us/rec/share/FX4nrKDGZLgw9HKdIQ8qdstnCoYvijj5PFMT14YM5lNIzzxjb0eZ0Cg8nQenkr2N.nLYpfTeXemBUdqEJ?startTime=1606240971000).

### Summary of Findings:
> Just a quick question, does this mean that it's been searched or it's been trending?

**Thoughts:** An improvement I could make is to modify the search results to make it clearer, potentially by adding titles or icons.

> "...very clean, user-friendly since there are filters..."
**Thoughts:** The participant could easily tell what that function/purpose of the application is, and likes the interface.

>"...I'm not too sure what the bottom tabs indicate since there are no words underneath."

**Thoughts:** To make the application more usefriendly and intuitive, I could add words underneath the icons in the navigation bar to clearly indicate what each button means.

## Accessibility (color-contrast) check
<img src="./[DH 150] Accessibility:Red.png" width="30%" height="30%"> 

In order to carry out my accessibility check, I used a Figma Plugin called [Able â€“ Friction free accessibility.](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/734693888346260052/Able-%E2%80%93-Friction-free-accessibility) After checking the accessibility of both my red and blue version, I decided to use blue as my primary colour scheme since the two shades of red failed the accessibility check, as seen from the screenshot above. That being said, if time permits, I am inclined to try out different shades of red to see if there is a combination that is appealing yet accessible.
