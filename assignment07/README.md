## High Fidelity Prototype
High-fidelity prototypes look like live software to customers, meaning participants would be more likely to behave naturally during testing. You can dive deep into a single component (like flow, visuals, engagement, or navigation) during user testing. This allows you to get detailed feedback on certain elements of the design that would not be possible with pen and paper.

## Description of Project
My project will support users by allowing them to order groceries. They will be able to do so online, without having to physically visit the grocery store.

## Graphic Design
Below are three distinctive screen designs that represent the user-interface design of my application with standard graphical components.

### How were decisions made?
For the colour scheme, I wanted something bright and enticing so users would be drawn to the application. However, since users are expected to be on this application for an extended period of time, the colour must be soothing to the eyes and not too garish. Both applications I analyzed for the heuristic evaluation (HKTVMall and Instacart) used green as their primary colour -- in order to differentiate my application from theirs, I decided not to use green. Below are four versions I created with different colours:

After creating the four versions, I decided to seek an outside perspective:

It seemed that both individuals preferred the red scheme, with one also liking the blue one. In order to decide, I used an accessibility checker to ensure that my colour scheme would be appropriate and userfriendly for all. 

## Impression Test
A recording of my impression test can be found via [this link](https://ucla.zoom.us/rec/share/FX4nrKDGZLgw9HKdIQ8qdstnCoYvijj5PFMT14YM5lNIzzxjb0eZ0Cg8nQenkr2N.nLYpfTeXemBUdqEJ?startTime=1606240971000).

### Summary of Findings:
> Just a quick question, does this mean that it's been searched or it's been trending?

**Thoughts:** An improvement I could make is to modify the search results to make it clearer, potentially by adding titles or icons.

> "...very clean, user-friendly since there are filters..."

**Thoughts:** The participant could easily tell what that function/purpose of the application is, and likes the interface.

>"...I'm not too sure what the bottom tabs indicate since there are no words underneath."

**Thoughts:** To make the application more usefriendly and intuitive, I could add words underneath the icons in the navigation bar to clearly indicate what each button means.

## Accessibility (color-contrast) check

In order to carry out my accessibility check, I used a Figma Plugin called [Able â€“ Friction free accessibility.](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/734693888346260052/Able-%E2%80%93-Friction-free-accessibility) After checking the accessibility of both my red and blue version, I decided to use blue as my primary colour scheme since the two shades of red failed the accessibility check, as seen from the screenshot above. That being said, if time permits, I am inclined to try out different shades of red to see if there is a combination that is appealing yet accessible.

## Reflection
This process was challenging but rewarding -- I believe it went more smoothly than the usability test since there was more flexibility in the user's actions, and I didn't feel myself pushing my participant to act a certain way. I am glad that I interviewed someone who was in my target demographic, since I was able to step out of my own shoes and get some insight into her perspective.

One thing I noticed was that I often gave examples of answers in my question, e.g. "Can you walk us through like how you go about choosing a red wine. For example, do you use the filters? Do you search?" Although this was instinctual and meant to aid the participant, I could have led her to answer a certain way. In the future, I will be aware of my questions and try to avoid biases or leading questions.

This was a very eyeopening experience, and allowed me to understand first-hand the importance of user research in creating a truly successful product.
