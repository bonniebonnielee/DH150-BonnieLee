# DH150-assignment08-BonnieLee

## Introduction
I am Bonnie Lee and I am currently taking DH 150: User Experience Design with Professor Sookyung Cho. For my project, I will be designing an online grocery delivery app for middle-aged women. Following the COVID-19 pandemic, online grocery shopping platforms such as Instacart have been rising in popularity as consumers find alternatives to in-person grocery shopping. I believe this platform would allow middle-aged women to have a quick and seamless online grocery shopping experience! These platforms typically have both a web and mobile version -- I will focus on the mobile app version since I have found that it typically has more usability issues than the web version. The competitors I am analyzing today are the iOS app versions of Instacart and HKTVmall.


## Design Statement
My project will support users by allowing them to order groceries. They will be able to do so online, without having to physically visit the grocery store.
