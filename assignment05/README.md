## Personas + Scenarios

## What is the purpose of UX storytelling?
UX storytelling is essential to successful user-centered design, and gives the designer an opportunity to truly step into a user's shoes. By imagining a user's perspective, one could identify why and how a product would be used, and spot pain points more easily. Through user personas, personalized stories and hypothetical scenarios, designers are able to empathize with users and better understand the user's experience when using the product. UX storytelling also eliminates a designer's personal biases, and create a product that is cohesive and focuses on intended users.

## Proposed Features for UX Design
### Feature 1: Special Instructions
Users have the option to include special instructions for their shopper when adding an item to cart.

### Feature 2: Platform-wide Search
Allows users to search for a desired item across different stores available on the platform.
