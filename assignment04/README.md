## Contextual Inquiry

## Main Design Challenge
### What is the main activity your project would support the usersâ€™ needs?
My project will support users by allowing them to order groceries. They will be able to do so online, without having to physically visit the grocery store.

### What is the basic need involved for that activity? 
The activity of buying groceries fulfills the user's physiological needs, since groceries include food and water, which is a fundamental physical requirement for human survival. With the pandemic, ordering groceries online also fulfills a user's safety needs, as users can order groceries form their own home instead of in-person, thus lowering their risk of COVID-19 exposure.

### What is/are the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
The traditional solution to satisfy the needs is to physically enter a store for in-person grocery shopping. Other solutions include going out to restaurants, getting takeout, or ordering delivery for food to fulfill physiological needs.

### What is/are the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
The time and physical effort it takes to grocery shop is the biggest limitation. Grocery shopping can be incredibly time consuming, as one has to physically travel to and from the store, and spend time looking for desired products. In addition, groceries can be very heavy, which may be difficult for some to carry. Digital technology would allow users to order groceries from home with minimal effort, which is especially useful since grocery shopping is a necessary and regular activity. Another limitation of in-person shopping is not knowing if certain products are in stock tuntil arriving at the store. With technology, users could visit a site and learn about the availability of different products right away.

## Target Users
### What are the characteristics of users? 
**Demographics:** Ideally middle-aged women, but suitable for all adults
**Preference:** Those who regularly buy grocery for their families, housewives, mums
**Expertise:** No expertised is required to use this application

### Where would the users do that activity? (i.e., context of use)
Traditionally, the users would do that activity at a grocery store, such as Ralphs or Trader Joe's. With technology, the user could grocery shop anywhere as long as they had access to internet, whether it be at home, at work, or during a commute. This could be done through a supermarket's official website (e.g. [ralphs.com](ralphs.com)) or online retailers such as Amazon.

### What would the users do to complete that activity? 
The goal of the activity is to have groceries at home. In the traditional solution, users would physically visit a grocery store, choose the items they would like to purchase, buy them then bring them home. Alternatively, users could order their desired grocery items from a website or app, pay via online payment transaction, and have the groceries delivered to their house.

## Research Method(s)
I conducted participatory observation research with my mum, who is part of my target demographic, and is familiar with both in-person and online grocery shopping. The contextual interview started with asking some background questions, then contextual questions and user feedback about the activities. Zoom was used to record the interview, user tasks, and transcript for this assignment.

### Key Findings

#### Having too many choices can make it difficult to make a decision
> if you're looking for something like say alcoholic beverages, but I don't know any of the brands, they carry actually too many items for me to choose. One thing I find it difficult is say if I want red wine, like they have over 3000 kinds of like red wines. So it's very difficult to find something or choose.

#### The importance of the "filter" function 
> Um, yeah, I need to use the filter because there's too many. And usually I think the one on top. What they show first is the one that I guess pays more on advertisement. So usually I go for the price high to low. 

#### The importance of re-finding previous orderes
> I'm ordering like stuff on a continuous basis. So usually I just look back at my previous... there's a history in my previous invoices. So I just pick it up from there.

#### The importance of a rating system to know more about a product
> Um if they can put in, like say for red wine, um, if there's like a reliable rating system so that like I know the quality, like I'll have more confidence when I pick that item.

#### Comparing online to in-person grocery shopping
> Easier is that I can do it anytime and they deliver door to door, so I don't have to go physically to a shop, you know, all the hassles. The difficult part is I don't actually order fresh produce online because I'm not too comfortable with the idea of the fresh produce like being in the van or something for hours and then being delivered to my home, and even stuff like frozen food like ice cream. I never ordered online because it doesn't, it doesn't seem to be a good idea, like it melted and then get frozen again.

#### The importance of knowing information about the product
> Tool. Oh, it'll be.. it'll be good, like if I can see, maybe virtually some of the products. Like because now, even if you click into a product, you can, well, you can read what's what's written on it, but it seems like sometimes it's not that clear on the size or like. And and especially like the the general comments rating on the product. Um, I want more information on that. 

## Reflection
The contextual inquiry process was challenging but rewarding -- I believe it went more smoothly than the usability test since there was more flexibility in the user's actions, and I didn't feel myself pushing my participant to act a certain way. I am glad that I interviewed someone who was in my target demographic, since I was able to step out of my own shoes and get some insight into her perspective.

One thing I noticed was that I often gave examples of answers in my question, e.g. "Can you walk us through like how you go about choosing a red wine. For example, do you use the filters? Do you search?" Although this was instinctual and meant to aid the participant, I could have led her to answer a certain way. In the future, I will be aware of my questions and try to avoid biases or leading questions. 

This was a very eyeopening experience, and allowed me to understand first-hand the importance of user research in creating a truly successful product.
