## Low Fidelity Prototype

## Project Description
**Purpose:** The purpose of low-fidelity prototyping is to test ideas early in the design process, ensuring that features implemented can achieve intended goals and are helpful for the target user.

**User Personas:** I developed two user personas as a result of my heuristic evaluation and user research: Sandra Brown, a soccer mum who puts family first, and Thomas Chan, a university fresh graduate and software engineer. More information and detail about the user personas can be found [here](https://github.com/bonniebonnielee/DH150-BonnieLee/tree/main/assignment05). These users do not need any level of technical expertise to use this application. 

**Features:** The following are features that I wrote as usage scenarios:
1. Platform-wide Search
2. Filter Results
3. Add Multiple Items to Cart

## Wireframes and Wireflows
[Here](https://github.com/bonniebonnielee/DH150-BonnieLee/blob/main/assignment06/%5BDH%20150%20Assignment06%5D%20Wireframes.pdf) are some basic wireframes from this prototype.

[Here](https://github.com/bonniebonnielee/DH150-BonnieLee/blob/main/assignment06/%5BDH%20150%20Assignment06%5D%20Wireframes%20and%20Wireflows.pdf) are all the wireframes and wireflows from this prototype.

[Here](https://github.com/bonniebonnielee/DH150-BonnieLee/blob/main/assignment06/%5BDH%20150%20Assignment06%5D%20Wireframes%20Test.pdf) are the results of the prototypting test.

### Notes on Wireflow Test
#### Task 1: Platform-wide Search
The user completed this task quickly since it was fairly straightforward, and was able to follow the wireflow easily. However, there was initial confusion about whether the search bar was intended to be used for stores or products, since the main page showed "Your Stores" and "More Stores" instead of products. My user also commented that this did not seem like a homepage. In future iterations, I will modify my wireframe to ensure it is clear that the platform-wide search is meant for products. 

#### Task 2: Filter Results
When asked to filter results by store, my user expected there to be a "Don't show this store" option on each store, instead of having to go through the "Filter" button". This could potentially be added as an accelerator and fulfil the "Flexibility and efficiency of use" heuristic. Looking at the filtering options (Store, Department, Brands, Sort), my user commented that it seemed too complex and filtering by department might not be necessary. She also mentioned that it was unintuitive for "Sort" to be under "Filter" instead of its own button. The user successfully managed to filter results by only showing those from Store #1 and Store #2. I will work towards simplifying the wireflow to make the process more intuitive.

#### Task 3: Add Multiple Items to Cart
Overall, this went very smoothly and my user was able to complete the task and add 2 Gala Apples to cart with no problem. My user suggested to update prices reflecting the new quantity after adding to cart, which is something that could be further explored. In addition, she reacted positively to the confirmation after adding items to cart, but did not like how it redirected her to the homepage upon clicking on "Continue Shopping". I will brainstorm ways to transition users for a seamless experience.

## Reflection
Creating and testing the low fidelity prototype was eyeopening since I was able to translate everything I learnt from the heuristic evaluation, user research, and design principles into something tangible. The wireflow process allowed me think critically about how users might interact with my product, as I had to complete interaction sequences for all possible choices, and present exit/cancel/back options as well. 

On the whole, I believe the prototype testing went smoothly since the user was able to perform all intended tasks without too much difficulty. This was a learning experience since I was able to get an outsider perspective, but I struggled with explaining how the wireframes and wireflows worked. I definitely got some valuable feedback from this test, and have identified opportunities for improvement. First, I have to ensure everything on the page has a clear and unified purpose, so there is no ambiguity about what a feature (e.g. search far) is supposed to do. In addition, I will simplify the information on each wireframe when a user filters results. Lastly, I will also give users more ways to get to different pages, instead of always redirecting them back to the homepage. These improvements will make my product more intuitive and user-friendly.
