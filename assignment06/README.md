## Low Fidelity Prototype

## Project Description
**Purpose:** The purpose of low-fidelity prototyping is to test ideas early in the design process, ensuring that features implemented can achieve inteded goals and are helpful for the target user.

**User Personas:** I developed two user personas as a result of my heuristic evaluation and user research: Sandra Brown, a soccer mum who puts family first, and Thomas Chan, a university fresh graduate and software engineer. More information and detail about the user personas can be found [here](https://github.com/bonniebonnielee/DH150-BonnieLee/tree/main/assignment05). These users do not need any level of technical expertise to use this application. 

**Features:** The following are features that I wrote as usage scenarios:
1. Platform-wide Search
2. Filter Results
3. Add Multiple Items to Cart

## Wireframes and Wireflows
Here are some basic wireframes from this prototype.
