## Pilot Usability Test

## Introduction
Instacart is a grocery delivery and pick-up service based in North America, which allows customers to order groceries from participating retailers, with shopping done by a personal shopper. It has gained popularity due to the COVID-19 pandemic, since it allows consumers to shop for groceries from the comfort of their own home.

## Purpose of Usability Testing
The following paragraph from [usability.gov](usability.gov) describes what a usability test is: "A usability test is intended to determine the extent an interface facilitates a userâ€™s ability to complete routine tasks. Typically the test is conducted with a group of potential users either in a usability lab, remotely (using e-meeting software and telephone connection), or on-site with portable equipment. Users are asked to complete a series of routine tasks. Sessions are recorded and analyzed to identify potential areas for improvement to the web site."

## Methodology
This is a pilot usability test, done in order to test the setting and materials.

### Setting
The onsite usability test was conducted using a live iOS version of the Instacart mobile app (version 7.49.0) located on my iPhone 11 Pro. The participant's facial expressions and comments were captured using the Photo Booth software on my laptop, while the participant's interactions with the product were captured by the my phone's default screen-recording software.

### Process
1. Introduction
2. Informed Consent
3. Background Questionnaire
4. Pre-test Questionnaire
5. Task Scenarios
6. Post-test Questionnaire
  * System Usability Scale 
  * Product Satisfaction Card
  * Demographics Data
  
### Tasks
After conducting a heuristic evaluation, I have decided to focus on these three heuristics in this usability test:
#### * Visibility of system status
When adding a product to cart directly from the shop's homepage, users are not informed about whether the item was actually added upon pressing the "+" button. This is particularly evident when adding multiple quantities of a product, which is which is why I decided the first user task would be to add 3 packs of a product to cart.

#### * User control and freedom
There is a lot of improvement in regards to this heuristic throughout this app, since users aren't given easy ways to leave an unwanted state, or undo/redo actions. The second user task requires the user to add then remove a product from favourites, which would test the ease in which one could undo a previous action.

#### * Aesthetic and minimalist design
The app contains a lot of irrelevant and duplicate information, such as the "Expore" and "Shop" tabs performing essentially the same function. For my last user task, the user is browsing through a category instead of a particular product, so will not be able to use the search function. Instead, they must use either the "Shop" or "Explore" tab.

The participant was asked to perform three tasks:
1. Add 3 packs of Robin Hood All Purpose Flour to cart
2. Add pan-fried turnip cake from T&T supermarket to favourites, then remove it from favourites.
3. See what household products are available in nearby stores.
