## Pilot Usability Test

## Introduction
Instacart is a grocery delivery and pick-up service based in North America, which allows customers to order groceries from participating retailers, with shopping done by a personal shopper. It has gained popularity due to the COVID-19 pandemic, since it allows consumers to shop for groceries from the comfort of their own home.

## Purpose of Usability Testing
A usability test is intended to determine the extent an interface facilitates a userâ€™s ability to complete routine tasks. Typically the test is conducted with a group of potential users either in a usability lab, remotely (using e-meeting software and telephone connection), or on-site with portable equipment. Users are asked to complete a series of routine tasks. Sessions are recorded and analyzed to identify potential areas for improvement to the web site.
