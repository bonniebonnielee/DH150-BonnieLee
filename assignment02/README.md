## Pilot Usability Test

## Introduction
Instacart is a grocery delivery and pick-up service based in North America, which allows customers to order groceries from participating retailers, with shopping done by a personal shopper. It has gained popularity due to the COVID-19 pandemic, since it allows consumers to shop for groceries from the comfort of their own home.

## Purpose of Usability Testing
The following paragraph from [usability.gov](usability.gov) describes what a usability test is: "A usability test is intended to determine the extent an interface facilitates a userâ€™s ability to complete routine tasks. Typically the test is conducted with a group of potential users either in a usability lab, remotely (using e-meeting software and telephone connection), or on-site with portable equipment. Users are asked to complete a series of routine tasks. Sessions are recorded and analyzed to identify potential areas for improvement to the web site."

## Methodology
This is a pilot usability test, done in order to test the setting and materials.

### Setting
The onsite usability test was conducted using a live iOS version of the Instacart mobile app (version 7.49.0) located on my iPhone 11 Pro. The participant's facial expressions and comments were captured using the Photo Booth software on my laptop, while the participant's interactions with the product were captured by the my phone's default screen-recording software.

### Process
1. Introduction
2. Informed Consent
3. Background Questionnaire
4. Pre-test Questionnaire
5. Task Scenarios
6. Post-test Questionnaire
    * System Usability Scale 
    * Product Satisfaction Card
    * Demographics Data
  
### Tasks
After conducting a heuristic evaluation, I have decided to focus on these three heuristics in this usability test:
* #### Visibility of system status
When adding a product to cart directly from the shop's homepage, users are not informed about whether the item was actually added upon pressing the "+" button. This is particularly evident when adding multiple quantities of a product, which is which is why I decided the first user task would be to add 3 packs of a product to cart.

* #### User control and freedom
There is a lot of improvement in regards to this heuristic throughout this app, since users aren't given easy ways to leave an unwanted state, or undo/redo actions. The second user task requires the user to add then remove a product from favourites, which would test the ease in which one could undo a previous action.

* #### Aesthetic and minimalist design
The app contains a lot of irrelevant and duplicate information, such as the "Expore" and "Shop" tabs performing essentially the same function. For my last user task, the user is browsing through a category instead of a particular product, so will not be able to use the search function. Instead, they must use either the "Shop" or "Explore" tab.

The participant was asked to perform three tasks:
1. Add 3 packs of Robin Hood All Purpose Flour to cart
2. Add pan-fried turnip cake from T&T supermarket to favourites, then remove it from favourites.
3. See what household products are available in nearby stores.

## Reflection
The pilot test went quite smoothly, and I learnt a lot throughout the process. 

A challenge I had was figuring out the set up of the usability test: since the product I'm focusing on is a mobile app, I was unable to conduct the usability test through Zoom as taught in class. I had to find an alternative where I would be able to simultaneously record and observe my participant's facial expressions and their interactions with the app, as well as ensuring that my paricipant can easily access the UT survey. I decided to conduct this pilot test in person, with my laptop being used for the survey and to record the sesssion, while my phone's innate screenrecording function would capture my participant's actions. I then made a note of the timestamp in which the screenrecording started, and superimposed the two videos together using iMovie. This went fairly well, but was very time consuming, and the shared screen covered parts of the recorded video. I believe there are better ways to conduct a usability test on an app which I can pursue. Something I didn't realize till after the UT concluded was that I was not in frame for most of the session -- although as a moderator, my physical presence on screen isn't as important as that of the participant, I should have been more aware of this, and ensured that my camera could capture both of us.

As for the actual usability test, I learnt that there are many different ways to perform a task. When coming up with the user task, I had a particular user flow in mind, but my participant did not follow those, and decided to use other functions instead. To improve, I should be more specific when describing a user task, so my participant will perform the intended user flow instead.

Another potential issue is that since Instacart requires an account to operate, and it is logged into my account, the information on the app is hyperpersonalized to my activiy history. There were instances during the UT in which the intended product was visible in a store's homepage since I had previously expressed interest in the product (when I was preparing the test). This meant that my participant could easily access such products, which defeated the purpose of the task. This is something I must address during my real usability test, so previous participants' actions don't influence the next ones.

In the future, I would like to improve my UT by finding a better set up to allow for a more positive and enlightening experience, and increase specificity during user secenarios. I would also like to hone my moderator skills and learn how to be more unbiased yet encouraging.
